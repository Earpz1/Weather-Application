# Weather Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Search any city supported by the OpenWeatherMap API
- Popular cities loaded by default
- Switch between Imperial and Metric units
- Images change on the search bar depending on the weather reported (BUGGY, not all weathers supported)

## Work in progress

- Save your own cities to favourites and have them loaded by default
- Weather Icons
- 5 day weather forecast
